====================================== */
//=============== 1.1.
2 threads are created during the execution of the program. One for the main thread and one for the thread "tid", which executes the runner function.

//=============== 1.2.
Line 16 is used to declares the variable for the thread "tid".
Line 17 is used to delcare the variable for the attribute of the thread "tid".
Line 20 is used to initialize the thread attribute object "attr". If NULL it uses the default values (whatever that means).
Line 22: Prints a statement to the console.
Line 23: Stores a user input in the global variable "max_value".
Line 26: Waits until the thread "tid" has finished.

//=============== 1.3.
Only 1 parameter is passed to runner(). In pthread_create, the 4th argument is the value passed to the function, which in this case is NULL.

//=============== 1.4.
The runner() function knows the value of max_value becuase max_value is defined as a global variable, accesible by all threads and scopes.

//=============== 1.5.
If line 26 is omitted, the value to search for is never found, because the thread synchronisation never takes place since pthread_join is omitted.
The rest of the main function executes before the runner function has a chance to synch with the main.
